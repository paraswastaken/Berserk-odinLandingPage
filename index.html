                <div>Berserk is awesome. (Let me convince you)</div>
                It's a really detailed, dark and mesmerising tale of a young boy who's only seen struggle in his life. He grows up in his fathers mercenary faction and goes on to become an exceptionally skilled and legendary warrior.<p>What I really like about Berserk
                is it's story, characters and it's subtle underlying life lessons. It's art style is also considered one of the best in the manga community, it's very detailed and gory, but at the same time captivatingly beautiful. Berserk has inspired a lot of other pop culture 
                trends and several other mangakas.</p><p>It's legendary status is also due the fact that Kentarou Miura, the creator of Berserk, dedicated a huge portion of his life to Berserk. His unfortunate demise is considered the biggest loss in the manga and anime community.</p>
